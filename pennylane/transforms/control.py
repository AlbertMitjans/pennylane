def ctrl(fn, control):
    """Create a method that applies a controlled version of the provided method.

    Args:
        fn (function): Any python function that applies pennylane operations.
        control (Wires): The control wire(s).

    Returns:
        function: A new function that applies the controlled equivalent of ``fn``. The returned
        function takes the same input arguments as ``fn``.

    **Example**

    .. code-block:: python3

        dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=4)

        def ops(params):
            qml.RX(params[0], wires=0)
            qml.RZ(params[1], wires=3)

        ops1 = qml.ctrl(ops, control=1)
        ops2 = qml.ctrl(ops, control=2)

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def my_circuit():
            ops1(params=[0.123, 0.456])
            ops1(params=[0.789, 1.234])
            ops2(params=[2.987, 3.654])
            ops2(params=[2.321, 1.111])
            return qml.state()

    The above code would be equivalent to

    .. code-block:: python3

        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def my_circuit2():
            # ops1(params=[0.123, 0.456])
            qml.CRX(0.123, wires=[1, 0])
            qml.CRZ(0.456, wires=[1, 3])

            # ops1(params=[0.789, 1.234])
            qml.CRX(0.789, wires=[1, 0])
            qml.CRZ(1.234, wires=[1, 3])

            # ops2(params=[2.987, 3.654])
            qml.CRX(2.987, wires=[2, 0])
            qml.CRZ(3.654, wires=[2, 3])

            # ops2(params=[2.321, 1.111])
            qml.CRX(2.321, wires=[2, 0])
            qml.CRZ(1.111, wires=[2, 3])
            return qml.state()

    .. Note::

        Some devices are able to take advantage of the inherient sparsity of a
        controlled operation. In those cases, it may be more efficient to use
        this transform rather than adding controls by hand. For devices that don't
        have special control support, the operation is expanded to add control wires
        to each underlying op individually.

    .. UsageDetails::

        **Nesting Controls**

        The ``ctrl`` transform can be nested with itself arbitrarily.

        .. code-block:: python3

            # These two ops are equivalent.
            op1 = qml.ctrl(qml.ctrl(my_ops, 1), 2)
            op2 = qml.ctrl(my_ops, [2, 1])
